- 👋 Hi, I’m @Group85GP, the 5G/B5G high-accuracy localization research group, at Purple Mountain Laboratories in China.
- 👀 I’m interested in advanced 5G localization techniques which include but not limited to high-accuracy AOA estimation, hybrid TDOA estimation, dynamic positioning, NLOS identification, mmW positioning, and machine-learning-based algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning indoor sub-meter positioning issues with commercial 5G systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some research institutions on 5G localization applications.
- 📫 How to reach me via 5GICP@pmlabs.com.cn
